This is the simpleset example: Using mix stochastic-deterministic DFT (MDFT) to calculate the total 
energy of Silicon(diamond) at the temperature of 0.6 Ry.

Note:
(1) Three input files are required in this calculation: 
INPUT(control parameters)
STRU(structures) 
KPT(k points, here we use 8 points with symmetry open)

(2) This is a self-consistent calculations (default) with plane wave basis (default).
(3) The pseudopotential file is also needed, which appears in STRU file.

Run the program(if permitted, otherwise please use a script to submit the job)
$ABACUS-path/ABACUS.fp_mpi-v1.0.1

Finish! Then you can see running_scf.log in OUT.ABACUS.
If you are not familiar with the parameters in INPUT, 
please check in OUT.ABACUS/INPUT.
