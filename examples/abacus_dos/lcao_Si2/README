This example show how to calculate the DOS(Density of States) of silicon (diamond).

Steps:
(1) ./step1.sh
(2) ./step2.sh

Finish! Then you can see DOS1_smearing.dat in OUT.ABACUS. The first column is energy,
and the second is density of states. Plot it!

Note:
1)If the "out_dos" is used, the DOS1_smearing.dat will appear in the directory.
2)The charge density needed to be output in scf calculations and be read
in non-self consistent calculations.
