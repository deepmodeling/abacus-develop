This is the simpleset example: Using numerical local basis to calculate the total 
energy of Silicon(diamond).

Note:

(1) There are two algorithms implemented within LCAO(Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals)
method, the first is when "gamma_only 1", which using only the Gamma point 
of k-points, this is efficient for cluster or large system.

The other one is when "gamma_only 0", which is used when k-points are needed,
for example, calculate the band structures. 


(2) Local Basis is used if "basis_type	lcao".


(3) Local Basis is set in the structure file,
"
NUMERICAL_ORBITAL
./Si_lda_8.0au_50Ry_2s2p1d
"
