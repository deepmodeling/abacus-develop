This example show how to perform noncollinear calculations in numerical atomic
orbital basis

BCC_Fe_NC_ground_state: calculates the ground state energy of Body center cubic iron
BCC_Fe_NC_deltaspin: use the deltaspin method to constrain atomic magnetic moments
deltaspin_constrain_value: use the deltaspin method to constrain atomic magnetic moments to a different value than the ground state
deltaspin_constrain_angle: use the deltaspin method to constrain atomic magnetic moments to a different direction than the ground state

Please also note that the provided examples are only shown for the functionality of the DeltaSpin method. Further carefull convergence of parameters (such as ecut, size of KPT, smearing method, etc.) should be tested before running the provided examples in research.
