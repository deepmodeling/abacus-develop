WELOCOME TO THE "ABACUS" PROGRAM.

There are generally 4 directories in this package.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently ABACUS provides the following features and functionalities:

1. Ground-state total energy calculations using Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory
(DFT) with local-density or generalized gradient approximations (LDA/GGAs).
2. Brillouin zone sampling using the Monkhorst-Pack special k-points.
3. Geometry relaxation with both Conjugated Gradient (CG) and BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShanno (BFGS) methods.
4. Semi-empirical van der Waals energy correction using the Grimme DFT-D2/D3 scheme.
5. NVT molecular dynamics simulation using the Nose-Hoover thermostat. 
6. Stress calculation and cell relaxation.
7. Electric polarization calculation using Berry Phase theory.
8. Interface to the Wannier90 package.
9. Real-time time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT).
10. Electrostatic potential.
11. Mulliken charge analysis.
12. Projected density of states (PDOS).
