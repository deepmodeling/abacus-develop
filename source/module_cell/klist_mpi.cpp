// on the plan of removal of GlobalC::parallel_kpoints, it is totally unreasonable to have such
// a class.

// Path: source/module_cell/parallel_kpoints.h, after refactor this class will be removed and
// the functions will be moved to module_cell/klist_mpi.cpp

// parallel_kpoints is instantiated in global.cpp, it's life span is presently unknown.
