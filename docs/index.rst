=================================================
Welcome to ABACUS Documentations!
=================================================

ABACUS is an open-source DFT software supporting both plane wave 
and numerical atomic basis. Apart from single-point calculations, 
we also allow geometry optimization, ab-initio molecular dynamics 
and as well as molecular dynamics with classical force fields (CMD). 
ABACUS supports LDA, GGA and meta-GGA functionals, with hybrid 
functionals under development. We also provide a variety of functionalities 
for simulating complex materials, including DFT+U correction, VdW correction 
and implicit solvation model.

Written in C++, ABACUS strives to provide a general infrastructure 
to facilitate the application of novel machine learning-assisted DFT methods 
in molecular and material simulations. We have successfully implemented 
the DeePKS method, as well as interfaces to DP-GEN and DeepH.
