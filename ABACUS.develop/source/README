Currently we are working on optimizing the code structure of ABACUS,
implementing new functions, and adding more autotests.

URGENT:

Ask Xiaohui Liu: all functions named with 'after_vc' should be reconstructed.
The 'FINAL_SCF' global varialble should be removed. 
(condition: need to reconstruct these codes within a given time)

Ask Xiaohui Liu and Daye Zheng: We need test examples.

Ask Fuxiang He: we need to remove all TDDFT-related global variables
in global_variable.h, we need TDDFT examples.
(condition: need to reconstruct these codes within a given time)

Ask Daye Zheng: MD, force, stress modules need reconstruction

NEED TO DO:

Ask Xiaohui: we need to remove DQ and NQX in global_variable.h, 
but the NQX is computed in ./src_pw/pseudopot_cell_vnl.cpp

Ask Peize: exx_lip.h and related Exx codes

QUESTION:

* in pw_basis.cpp, why ggwfc2=ggwfc if gamma_only is used?
